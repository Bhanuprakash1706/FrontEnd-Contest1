    <p id="h1">About Yoga</p>
    <p id="text">Yoga is an ancient practice that has changed over time.
    
    Modern yoga focuses on poses designed to stimulate inner peace and physical energy. Ancient yoga did not place as much
    emphasis on fitness. Instead, it revolved around cultivating mental focus and expanding spiritual energy.
    
    There are many different types of yoga available. The style a person chooses will depend on their expectations and level
    of physical agility.
    
    People with certain health conditions, such as sciatica, should approach yoga slowly and with caution.
    
    Yoga can help support a balanced, active lifestyle.</p>
